tar -xvf avr8-gnu-toolchain-3.5.4.1709-linux.any.x86_64.tar.gz

Downloaded BeagleBoneBlack toolchain:
wget https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/6.2-2016.11/arm-linux-gnueabihf/gcc-linaro-6.2.1-2016.11-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz

If you re-run
    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<Toolchain-*.cmake> ..
from the command line, you will get the warning:
    Make Warning:
      Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:

        CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE

Sometimes.
[This is because the file has already been used/processed. If there are changes to the Toolchain file, then this warning will not appear.] Maybe not...

Does CppUTest need to be cross-compiled for the target??
cd cpputest-3.8/cpputest_build/
cpputest_build/
../configure --prefix=/home/kevin/coding/install --build=x86_64 --host=arm-linux-gnueabihf
make
make check
make tdd
make install

Cross-compiling CppUTest for AVR may not work; it requires cstdlib, which doesn't seem to exist. :/
As an experiment, move on to the Sitara. I know that CppUTest can be run and compiled for this.
