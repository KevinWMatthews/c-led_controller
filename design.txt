Brainstorming on what this program could do.

Let's start simple: push a button and toggle the LED's state.
We could drop this directly into main but then we can't test it except on the hardware.
Create an abstraction layer so we can run tests.

Push button             -> Detect GPIO input state changes.
Change the LED state    -> Set gpio output

There are already abstraction layers for the LED. We should be able to create it, set its initial state, and change its state:
    Led_Create()
    Led_TurnOn(led)
    Led_TurnOff(led)

There are not yet abstraction layers for a button. We need to create:
    Buttton_Create()
    Detect button press/release.
    Input GPIO


How to detect button state change? Must be real-time and track press/release:
    Store button initial state (released?).
    When a button press is detected,
        Set a flag that this button press has been processed.
            If the LED state change encounteres an error, tough; the button press has been processed.
        Change the LED state.
    While the button is still pressed,
        do nothing.
    When a button release is detected,
        Clear the flag that the button press has been processed.
        Do not change the LED state.
    While the button is released,
        Do nothing.

   Think about the logic that we use. What if a button press is missed? What if a release is missed?

   Should this depend on a gpio abstraction layer? Yes, let's try this. There is a mock ATtiny861 interface.
