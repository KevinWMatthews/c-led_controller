# Build and install CppUTest locally.
git clone https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest.git CppUTest
cd CppUTest
cd cpputest_build       # They provide this build directory.
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/kevin/coding/c/led_controller/install/ ..
TODO should we customize? can use
make edit_cache
make
make test
make install


# Now configure my project:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/kevin/coding/c/led_controller/install -DCPPUTEST_HOME=/home/kevin/coding/c/led_controller/install ..
make
#Fails
