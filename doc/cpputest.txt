CppUTest link error:
    INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES is getting set improperly in CppUTestTargets.cmake
    If I shorten /include/CppUTest to /include, then the library will link properly using
    find_package().

    I am not sure how this gets set during the CppUTest build.
    I am not sure if I am linking against the library properly.
    If I answer both of these questions I'd like to fix the error.

    See install/lib/CppUTest/cmake/CppUTestTargets.cmake
        set_target_properties(CppUTest PROPERTIES
          INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES "${_IMPORT_PREFIX}/include/CppUTest"
        )
