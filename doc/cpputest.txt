CppUTest link error:
    CppUTest appears to be configured incorrectly after it is installed.

    See <your_install_dir>/lib/CppUTest/cmake/CppUTestTargets.cmake:
        set_target_properties(CppUTest PROPERTIES
          INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES "${_IMPORT_PREFIX}/include/CppUTest"
        )

    INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES seems to be set improperly, or I don't know how to link properly.
    Replace:
        INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES "${_IMPORT_PREFIX}/include/CppUTest"
    with:
        INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES "${_IMPORT_PREFIX}/include"

    I am not sure how this gets set during the CppUTest build.
    I am not sure if I am linking against the library properly.
    If I answer both of these questions I'd like to fix the error.
