There are two banks of pins on the ATtiny61. These are referred to as PORTA and PORTB. Conveniently, there are 16 pins so two 8-bit registers is enough to provide complete control.

Each GPIO is controlled with three registers:
    Address     Name                            Description
    PORTx       Data Register                   Drive output pin high or low; control input pin's internal pull-up resistor
    DDRx        Data Direction Register         Set GPIO as input (0) or output (1)
    PINx        Port Input Pins                 Read the value of the pin or write the value of PORTx


DDRx        Data Direction Register
    Configure the direction of a pin
    0       input
    1       output

PORTx       Data Register
    When input:
        1       Enable internal pull-up
        0       Disable internal pull-up
    When output:
        1       Drive pin high
        0       Drive pin low

PINx        Port Input Pins
    Read:
        Read the value of PINxn. Can be read regardless of the pin direction (DDRxn).
    Write:
        Writing a value of 1 to PINxn toggles the value of PORTxn regardless of the state of DDRxn (!).
        See ATtiny861 datasheet, 10.1.2.


Unconnected pins (10.1.6):
    Set unused pins as an input with an internal pull-up.
