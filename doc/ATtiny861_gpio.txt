There are two banks of pins on the ATtiny61. These are referred to as PORTA and PORTB. Conveniently, there are 16 pins so two 8-bit registers is enough to provide access to all gpio.

Each GPIO is controlled with three registers:
    Register    Name                            Description
    PORTx       Data Register                   Drive output pin high or low/control input pin's internal pull-up resistor
    DDRx        Data Direction Register         Set GPIO direction: input (0) or output (1)
    PINx        Port Input Pin Address          Read the value of the pin/write the value of PORTx


DDRx        Data Direction Register
    Write:
        Configure the direction of a pin:
            0       input
            1       output
    Read:
        ?

PORTx       Data Register
    Write:
        When input:
            1       Enable internal pull-up
            0       Disable internal pull-up
        When output:
            1       Drive pin high
            0       Drive pin low
    Read:
        When input:
            ?
        When output:
            ?

PINx        Port Input Pin Address
    Read:
        Read the value of PINxn. Can be read regardless of the pin direction (DDRxn).
    Write:
        Writing a value of 1 to PINxn toggles the value of PORTxn regardless of the state of DDRxn (!).
        This will:
            for an input, change the state of the internal pull-up
            for an output, change the pin state
        See ATtiny861 datasheet, 10.1.2.
        Does writing 0 do anything?

It is possible to override the state of any pin. See Table 10.2
There is also a pull-up disable bit in MCUCR, the MCU Control Register. See section 10.3.1.

Unconnected pins (10.1.6):
    Set unused pins as an input with an internal pull-up.
