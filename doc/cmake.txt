add_library(<name> <STATIC | SHARED | MODULE> IMPORTED)

set_property(TARGET <target> PROPERTY <property> <value>)
TARGET means we will operate on a target, not a directory or source file.

CMake will search the install prefix for libraries!
    "The installation prefix is also added to CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH so that find_package(), find_program(), find_library(), find_path(), and find_file() will search the prefix for other software."


A double colon in a library forces the library to be a target.
If the library is not found, CMake will throw an error during build system generation instead of during link time.

When extending a targets list of sources using target_sources(),
list .c files using the PRIVATE property of the target.
If you populate PUBLIC, the .c file could/will be linked against twice.
Header files can be PUBLIC, PRIVATE, or INTERFACE as needed.

# Specify an alias library for other targets to link against.
# This is not required but enables to CMake to throw an error while it
# is generating the build system if the library is not found.
# Otherwise, we must wait until the linker fails (after compilation).
