libhw_ATtiny861:
    Abstraction layer/library around the hardware.
    Figure out all things hardware, then implement and document them in this library.
    The goal is that all hardware interactions take place through this library, which
    allows a single implementation to be designed and tested.
    Ideally the user will not need to reference the chip's datasheet; everything
    should be provided here.


led_blink:
    Blink an LED periodically.

    Depends on:
        libhw_ATtiny861GPIO
        AVR's util/delay.h.
            For _delay_ms(), but I'd like to convert it to use the chip's internal timers.

util/delay.h:
    The easiest way to track time is with the AVR function _delay_ms().
    This method is not easily viable for mocking.
    See: http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__util__delay.html
    _delay_ms() requires:
        its argument to be an integer constant that is known at compile-time
        optimization to be enabled
    They optimize away the floating point calculations during compilation.
