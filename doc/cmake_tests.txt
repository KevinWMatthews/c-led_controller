# You must first enable tests:
enable_testing()

# To add a test,
add_test(
	NAME <test_name>
	COMMAND <command_to_run>		# If an executable name, CMake handles paths for you!
)

# Run all tests with:
make test                           # Does not accept options?
                                    # Does *not* rebuild source code!
# or
ctest

# Run individual tests with:
ctest -R <test_name>

# CTest suppresses test output. To show it, run
ctest --output-on-failure
# or
ctest -V

# If you to run the tests unfettered by CTest (say, while developing a module),
# the executables are still located in the build/bin/ directory.
