Can't return a NULL Led struct any longer....

Check the LED state against the 'hardware' - set up a mock and get its status.
    We need to ensure that the hardware LED is turned off when a software Led is created.

        CMake:
Can CMake get link-time substitution right for mocks?
Do we need to install LedControllerConfig.h in install/include? It works when I don't.
