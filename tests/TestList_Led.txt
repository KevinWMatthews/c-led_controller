Turn on multiple LEDs. This will require a more complex mock.

Hardware mock:
    Check the LED state against the 'hardware' - set up a mock and get its status.

    The actual hardware mock requires (well, is more useful if it has) some knowledge of how the hardware works, I think.
    For example, we will create a dummy hardware register rather than implement, say, an I2C call.
    For the short term, let's implement a very basic mock so I don't need to research how the hardware works.

    We will use this to:
        verify initialization
        verify state
        change state

Null checks:
    Led_GetState()
    Led_TurnOn()

        CMake:
Can CMake get link-time substitution right for mocks?
Do we need to install LedControllerConfig.h in install/include? It works when I don't.
