Need to be able to read pin state.
    Should we add an invalid state? Test for this.
    Yes. Check for an invalid state.
    Test SetState() functions.

Extract GPIO map.
Extract functions that set gpio?

Determine behavior of GPIOs for input and output pins.
Does this affect the behavior of GetState() and SetState()?


Properly read pins. We need to read PIN and not PORT but my mock
isn't smart enough to have different behavior for test and production code.



ATtiny861_GpioSetAsOutput()
    Handle invalid pins

Create a set of defines that correspond to the pin numbers? That would be nice!
Finish all pins.
Set outputs high!

Can we change ATtiny861.h to use defines from io.h? No, we get mixed up with PORTB.
Set up tests that ensure that the mock is properly cleared....

Can we get away with registers as uint8_t and using pointers?

I'm creating a chip interface. Test it!
