Design a libhw_attiny861 module that grants access to the two hardware timers.
For simplicity, start with only one timer and one interrupt source:
    Timer0, Compare Match A.

Create():
    # Configure the timer.
    Do not allow multiple creates without a destroy.
    ?   Disable timer
    Set:
        -   8-bit mode
        -   CTC/compare mode
        -   No input capture mode
        -   Enable Compare Match A interrupts
        -   Set Compare A value
        x   Enable Compare Match B interrupts
        x   Set Compare B value
        x   Enable overflow interrupts

Register callback():
    # This allows the user to execute periodic behavior.
    -   Define the ISR in the Timer module.
    -   Multiple callbacks? As needed.
    -   Do not allow multiple callbacks to be registered (right now) - replace existing.
    -   NULL should clear the callback.

Callback execution:
    -   Execute callback
    -   Do not segfault with NULL callback.

    * This mock may needs tests of its own! *
    Do not execute if timer is stopped.
    Do not execute if MatchA interrupts are not enabled.
    Ignore the flag register.
    Ignore the global interrupt register; assume that global interrupts are enabled.

X Unregister callback:
    If needed.

Start():
    ? Clear Timer0 prescaler
    -   Start timer - set clock source.
    -   Do not set global interrupts!
        The user needs control of that; it should happen just before the main loop.
    ? Do not allow start unless timer has been Created.
    ? Reset prescaler and counter register
        The counter register should be fine.
        The prescaler applies to both timers, doesn't it? Sounds dangerous.

Stop:
    x   Stop timer - set clock source. As needed.

X Change interval:
    As needed.
    What if we need to change the clock interval/match value at runtime?
    This gets complicated with the prescaler.
    We could hold it in reset using Timer0 Synchronization Mode - TSM bit of TCCR0B register.
    Then reset the Timer0 prescaler?

X Destroy:
    As needed; currently nothing for it to do.
    Must stop the timer if needed.
    Free any handles.
    Do not allow start.

X HW:
    Haven't actually tried Compare Match B.
    Check and see if CTC mode checks both Output Compare Registers A and B when in 8-bit mode.
