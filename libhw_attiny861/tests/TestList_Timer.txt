Design a libhw_attiny861 module that grants access to the two hardware timers.
For simplicity, start with only one timer.

The timer will trigger an interrupt. We need to put behavior in this interrupt.
We can either:
    Can we define the interrupt in our module? Perhaps so....
    Allow the user to register a callback and tell them to define the interrupt and place our callback code there.
    Tell the user to do put their code in the interrupt.

Create:
    Set the correct pins, whatever that requries.
    Ideally just the time interval.
    Perhaps also the HW timer number?
    Do not allow multiple creates without a destroy.

Register callback:
    Allow the user to execute periodic behavior.
    Define the ISR in the Timer module.

Start:
    Will start be separate from create?
    Do not set global interrupts!
        The user needs control of that; it should happen just before the main loop.
    Start timer or enable interrupt?

Stop:
    Will stop be separate from teardown?
    Stop timer or disable interrupt?

Destroy:
    Free any handles.
    Turn off the timer?
