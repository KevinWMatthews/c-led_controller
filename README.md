# LED Controller
Welcome! This is a simple LED controller.
It is intended to be an example of design patterns as a simple project grows to be complex.

## Build Setup
This project was designed to be built with CMake.
This is so that it is compatible with CLion and because I'm sick of using autotools.

To configure an out-of-tree build,
    * mkdir build
    * cd build
    * cmake ..
Various make commands can be run from within build/ and will not clutter up the source directory.
