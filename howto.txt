Build CppUTest:
    Create subdirectory: mkdir CppUTest; cd CppUTest
    Download CppUTest: https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest/releases/download/v3.8/cpputest-3.8.tar.gz
    Untar: tar -xvf cpputest-3.8.tar.gz
    Create custom build directories for out-of-tree:
        cd cpputest-3.8.tar.gz

    Build CppUTest for the PC (I struggled with autotools):
        cd cpputest_build
        cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/CppUTset/install ..
        Configure CMake from the command line:
            cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/kmatthews/coding/c/led_controller/CppUTest/install ..
        Configure Cmake using cmake-gui:
            TODO
        make
        make test
        make install

    Build LedController for the PC:
        cd led_controller
        mkdir build
        cmake -DCPPUTEST_HOME=/home/kmatthews/coding/c/led_controller/CppUTest/install -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/kmatthews/coding/c/led_controller/install ..

    Cross-compile CppUTest for the BeagleBoneBlack:
        mkdir cpputest_build_bbb
        cd cpputest_build_bbb
        Configure CMake from the command line:
            # Create a Toolchain.cmake file that is specific to your system.
            # Cross-compilation with fail if the tests are compiled and run (-DTESTS).
            cmake -DTESTS=OFF -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/home/kmatthews/coding/c/led_controller/Toolchain-beagleboneblack.cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/kmatthews/coding/c/led_controller/CppUTest/install_bbb ..
        Configure Cmake using cmake-gui:
            TODO
        make
        make install

    Cross-compile LedController for the BeagleBoneBlack:
        cd led_controller
        mkdir build_bbb
        cd build_bbb
        Configure CMake from the command line:
            cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/home/kmatthews/coding/c/led_controller/Toolchain-beagleboneblack.cmake -DCPPUTEST_HOME=/home/kmatthews/coding/c/led_controller/CppUTest/install_bbb -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/kmatthews/coding/c/led_controller/install_bbb ..
        Configure Cmake using cmake-gui:
            TODO
        make
        make install
        # Run tests manually, at the moment.

    Cross-compilation for the AVR ATtiny861 is not yet complete.
        Must compile with out C stdlib (and C++ stdlib?).
        Tests are overflowing .text
        Mocks need to be removed - can't find all dependencies. However, they shouldn't be needed; use real memory registers.
        Remove CppUTestExt as well?
        Learn how to pass correct compiler options.

autotools creates targes for:
    make check
    make tdd
CMake does not.
