Blink two leds periodically (as slow as possible with pre-scaling only).
Blink two instead of one so the difference between active low and active high leds is obvious.

Requires/responds to hardware change.

SetState will need to know which GPIO state direction.
GetState will need to know which GPIO state is active.
